# Alg DB

This is an open-source database for cubing algorithms. It is free for anyone to use and contribute to.

- Alg sets: 19
- Cases: 1683
- Algs: 3761

The algorithm database is maintained by CubingApp. You can view the [algorithm database here](https://cubingapp.com/algdb.html)

## Want to help?

Here are some ways you can help.

### 1. Categorize each algorithm into subsets  
We are in the process of adding subsets to each algorithm, and this is a long-term effort. The goal is to have subsets for each algorithm set so users can easily find algs.

For example, a Dot OLL algorithm would be stored like this:
```
{
  "name": "OLL 1",
  "subsets": ["Dot"],
  "algs": [
    "R U2 R2 F R F' U2 R' F R F'",
    "y R U' R2 D' r U' r' D R2 U R'",
    "R' U' F R' F' R2 U R f' U' f",
    "L' U2 L2 F' L' F U2 L F' L' F"
  ]
},
```

### 2. Add new algorithms or algorithm sets
